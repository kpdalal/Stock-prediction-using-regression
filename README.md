# Stock-prediction-using-regression-kmeans

Aim: To use Scikit learn to try out 4 different ML models (3 Linear Regression models and 1 Regression based on k-nearest neighbors)to predict the price of a particular stock (Reliance industries in this case) for a future date. Further, the prediction is visualized using Matplotlib library.

The code is divided into 8 parts. The brief of which is given below
Part 1- Importing libraries/packages and datasets for stock related information from yahoo finance
Part 2- Creating data frames to work upon
Part 3- Data wangling step along with pre-processing.
Part 4- Splitting available data into training and testing data sets.
Part 5- Training ML models.
Part 6- Finding the score of each ML model to find the best one to use further for prediction.
Part 7- Forecasting using the model with the best score
Part 8- Visualizing the prediction through line chart created using Matplotlib.
